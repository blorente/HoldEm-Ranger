# Welcome to Hold'em Ranger

Ranger is a new, simple and portable way to store your Texas Hold'Em ranges.

## What it offers

Ranger offers the following features:

- Create, store and load your ranges.
- Up to 4 different colors.
- A portable file format (`.rng`), to be able to **share** your ranges.
- The possibility to load all ranges in a folder, to easily switch between them in game.

Here's a demonstration:

## What it does not (and doesn't intend to)

- No equity calculations (we have (Equilab)[https://www.pokerstrategy.com/poker-software-tools/equilab-holdem/] for that)
- No tracking.

# For the Geeks

Ranges is built in NodeJS with Electron. It stores ranges in pure JSON so that they can even be crafter from outside it.
